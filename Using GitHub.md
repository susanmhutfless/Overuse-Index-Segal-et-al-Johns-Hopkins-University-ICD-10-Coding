# Using GitHub

## **I want to work on github with the team.  How do I do this?**
1.	Create a github profile: https://github.com/
2.	Download github desktop (or use IDE if experienced programmer)
3.	Watch this video on github for non-programmers (it’s only 11 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XhbYHcaT9k

## **I want to make a contribution to a repo.  How do I do this?**  Note: These instructions are specific to Github Desktop.  If you have experience working with github and want to use an IDE, do your usual thing—there is no need for you to work from the desktop software.
1.	Make sure you have access to the git repo (Ask Susie for access—you will get an email invite to access the repo for the first time—she will need  your username to add you)
2.	Clone the git repo onto your desktop
a.	You can do this with github desktop software OR if you are an experienced programmer, do this your usual way
3.	Fetch to refresh (yours should look like B)
4.	Make a new branch
a.	Name this something that would make sense to someone other than you
i.	Yes: “labeling_variables” 
ii.	NOT “update code”
5.	Your first branch will be from the master unless you are told differently.  Feel free to make sub-branches off of your branches.
6.	Commit often making comments about what you did.  When you have completed a task, create a pull request.  Say what you did so another team member can code review.  Make a pull request for a specific task (not 200 lines of code).  Some examples:
a.	Commit example description 1: Label all variables
b.	Commit example description 2: Format variables and checked that table1 macro works for this  population
c.	Commit example description 3: Counted number of cd, uc, ibd encounters and output to a 1 record per person file

## **I want to review/approve a pull request.**
1.	Try watching the video above (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XhbYHcaT9k) starting at around 4:30 to walk you through pull requests again.  Pull requests are called PR in this video.
2.	Find all the pull requests in your repo.  They are listed in the tab Pull Requests. 
3.	Click on the pull request that you want to review.
4.	Make comments, wait for response, call the person if needed.  Merge the pull request once the code works and is ready for merging to master.

# **Rules of working on github**
•	Fetch first
•	Check your branch
•	Never work on master
•	Make a new branch for a new task
•	Never put data on github repo
•	Create pull requests on team repo
•	1 other person must review code before merging
o	A task is not “done” until someone else reviews/merges
•	Commit often
o	Add descriptive comments to commits so it’s easy for the team to follow along when it’s time to code review (CR) your PR (pull request)
•	Never merge to master on the local machine
•	Don’t delete another person’s branch
•	If someone (=even your supervisor!) isn’t following GitHub etiquette, let them know.  It’s usually not intentional and they need a reminder to review the etiquette again.
