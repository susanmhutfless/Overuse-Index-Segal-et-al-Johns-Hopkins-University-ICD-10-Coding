## 22: Problem with Excel file regarding absence of inclusion criteria (SH asked JS to revise on 28jun2020) & problem with code because EKG has dx inclusion but there are no dx inclusion listed (there are no inclusion criteria listed despite assumed eligibility of having a CT based on written description).  SH waiting on Excel edits from JS and codes edits from EKG based on the excel edits.
## 21: Problem with Excel file.  Lists ICD dx inclusion criteria that is the outcome.  Problem with code: requires dx code (based on excel file) but the inclusion should be aged 80 and older & aged 80 and older for popped (age not listed in upper section describing how to set up overuse measure which is important if want to apply to other datasets).  SH asked JS to modify Excel and EKG to modify code based on Excel on 28jun2020.
## 20: Edits needed to Excel file and code.  SH requested EKG and JS make these edits on 28jun2020.
