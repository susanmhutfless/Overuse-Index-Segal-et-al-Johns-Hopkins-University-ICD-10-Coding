/*Description from Excel file*/
(New) Number 		2	
Indicator 		Donâ€™t perform unproven diagnostic tests, such as immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing or an indiscriminate battery of immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests, in the evaluation of allergy.
Indicator
			Motivator: IgG testing has no relevance to allergy; IgE testing should be very selective

			Indictor: IgG testing where the primary diagnosis is allergy or broad IgE testing where the primary diagnosis is allergy

			[this can be reported among all patients with IgG and IgE testing]

Timing		Inclusionary diagnosis code is associated with the procedure code (same claim)
			or same admission (with primary diagnosis)	

System		Allergy	

Actor		Allergists, primary care
